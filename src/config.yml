# A "group" is a collection of worlds which will share an inventory.
#  In this example there are two groups, a creative and a survival group
#  Each group has an overworld and a nether, which will share an inventory

# Inventory switching examples
# Scenarios when the inventory will not switch:
#  creative_overworld to creative_nether
#  survival_nether to survival_overworld
#  survival_end to survival_overworld
# Scenarios when the inventory will switch:
#   creative_overworld to survival_end
#   survival_nether to creative_nether
